I decided to choose the data with regards to the import of coal from abroad to 
germany as the central dataset for my individual project. I sense there is a 
scope for thorough investigation and coal imports is a major source of energy 
for most economies in the world. The cost-volume analysis can give insight into 
the energy landscape around when the data was recorded. The data has been divided 
into the country of origin for the coal per month since 200x. The features provided
were tonnes of coal imported, and their equivalent energy output, and the cost of 
the total coal imported.
